# TDD Practice - Christmas Lights Kata

I'm trying to figure out how/when I need to be writing tests for things. This
is the solution to a Kata that, at this point, has been super over-engineered.

Also, I'm practicing my OOPing, so it's super inefficient, creating one million
objects for each Grid test, but that's how I envision a grid of lights working.
They still need to exist, even if they're off.

This obviously could have been done with a simple array-based answer instead.
